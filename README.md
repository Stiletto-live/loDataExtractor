# loDataExtractor

Data extractor for the game Last Oasis. Used to generate a JSON with the desired data from the different items.

## How it works

The program reads all the useful game jsons and parses them to get what is needed.

## Instructions

-- The important folders are: Content/Mist/Data/, Content/Localization/Game
-- Clone this repository and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/)
-- Install project dependencies: "npm install"
-- Create an .env with the data. Similar to the example
-- Run the program: "npm run start"
